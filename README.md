They have hired a Data Analyst to explore diverse books currently being published for children.  Their inquiries are below:

**1. What is the current environment of diverse children's books published in the US?**

**2. What diverse subjects should we focus on for our first few titles?**

**3. How can we establish ourselves quickly as a diverse book publisher?**
